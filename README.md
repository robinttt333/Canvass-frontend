![Canvass Demo](https://github.com/robinttt333/Canvass-backend/blob/master/canvass.gif)


Canvass is a social netoworking application built using `react` + `graphql` + `apollo Server` + `sequelize`.Here are some of its features:

  - Signup and Login
  - Realtime news feed
  - Realtime messaging
  - Custom profile section with updates
  - Realtime posts + comments

### Tech
As mentioned previously `Canvass` uses the following technologies
* [Apollo Server] - A community-maintained open-source GraphQL server
* [Graphql] - An open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs
* [Reactjs] -  An open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components
* [Semantic UI] - A UI framework designed for theming
* [Express] - A web application framework for Node.js
* [Sequelize] - A promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server

### Installation

Clone the repo and run 

```js
yarn
```
or 
```js
npm install
```
to install the necessary packages.Once that is done just run 
```js
npm start
```
and you will have a react app running if the repo is `Canvass-frontend`
or apollo server if it is `Canvass-backend`.
